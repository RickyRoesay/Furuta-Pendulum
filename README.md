# Furuta-Pendulum
Rotary Inverse Pendulum that acts like a cool desktop toy.  This project is a work in progress.
Inspired by [Ben Katz.](https://build-its-inprogress.blogspot.com/search/label/Pendulum)

**Goals:**  
  * Cheap to make.  That means no $100 encoders or outsourced manufacturing.
  * (Relatively) Easy to manufacture and assemble.  Only 3D printed parts and off the shelf components. No metalworking lathes.
  * Must have a screen and buttons for a selectable mode of operation (swing up, swing down, etc).  *It's not feature creep, I swear!*
  * LED's that track the position and angle of the pendulum.  *Totally not feature creep!*
  * Project timeline should be less than a year.  Must use/adapt pre-existing software and hardware when possible.
