Tested with a more powerful 170W version of the lenovo chargers.  

This was measured with a much more expensive scope and current sensor than the first hot plug test.  

The yellow signal is the voltage measured at the input of the motor controller using the tektronix passive probe that came with the scope

the green signal is the inrush current after attaching the connector to the harness I made.  It was measured using a very high bandwidth, +/- 300A rogowski coil.
